# pirates
NFT test, smart contracts are deployed in the Ropsten testnet network of Ethereum
## Use(Sorry I uploaded node modules....)
* Install metamask extension in the browser
  * Create and account and change network to Ropsten
  * https://faucet.ropsten.be/ use this faucet to get come testnet ETH
* Run yarn dev...it will ask you to connect to your metamask extension when you open the website
* Once the site is up you can create some pirates...The only functions working(interacting with the smart contract are Create pirate and list pirates...)











## Future work to improve the game and build a whole ecosystem: I was just testing with this...Just for me.....
– Create another unfungible token pets to interact with pirates…
– Create a token that act as money for pirates to pay for ransoms and steal from another pirates once in fight…the losers pirates will see decreased its treasure
– Posibility to create a crew with a captain, to attack another crew and distribute the lot
– Create a better design for pirates according to its attributes, configuring all its body parts…
– Create skills for pirates to be used in combat, so like improve the function for attacking others pirates and crews according to combat skills…
